# Clojure Linemode

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bwhmather/clj-linemode.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/bwhmather/clj-linemode)

Clojure library for communicating with line-mode thermal printers.
Currently works only with printers that support the star line mode protocol but adding support for other similar printers should be possible.
